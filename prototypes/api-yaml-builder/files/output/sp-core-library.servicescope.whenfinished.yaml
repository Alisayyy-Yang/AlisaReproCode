summary:
  - elementKind: text
    text: >-
      It is an error to call ServiceScope.consume() before finish() has been called. The most reliable way to protect
      your component against this error is to perform the consume() calls inside a whenFinished() callback. If the
      service scope is already finished, then the callback will be executed immediately; otherwise, it will be executed
      later when the scope is finished.
